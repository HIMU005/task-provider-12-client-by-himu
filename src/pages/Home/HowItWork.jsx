                Upon registering on the website, new users can select their role. If a new user logs in with Gmail for the first time, they are automatically designated as a worker. Role changes are exclusively managed by the Admin, who cannot demote another Admin. Workers receive 10 coins, while Task Creators receive 50 coins upon registration. Task Creators have the option to purchase additional coins using a card for testing purposes. Workers can withdraw their coins via bKash, Nagad, or Rocket (BD payment methods), provided they submit authentic information. Admins have the authority to delete tasks and confirm withdrawal requests. Task Creators are limited to accepting or rejecting task submissions. This structured approach ensures a streamlined and professional user experience.</p>
